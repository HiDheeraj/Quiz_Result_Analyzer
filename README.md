📌 Project Overview

This repository is a complete collection of C programming exercises designed to strengthen fundamental programming concepts. It covers a wide range of topics including arrays, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, macros, file handling, structures, unions, typedefs, and sorting/searching algorithms.

Each program is written with simplicity and clarity in mind, making it useful for beginners revising concepts, as well as for students preparing for university exams or coding practice.

🛠 Features

✅ Arrays – Traversal, insertion, deletion, resizing

✅ Pointers – Basics, pointer arithmetic, pointer to functions

✅ Dynamic Memory Allocation – malloc, calloc, realloc, free

✅ Macros – Preprocessor directives and constants

✅ File Handling – Reading, writing, appending, handling text/binary files

✅ Structures & Unions – User-defined data types, memory optimization

✅ Typedefs – Simplifying complex declarations

✅ Sorting & Searching Algorithms – Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, binary search, linear search

🎯 Purpose

📘 Strengthen C programming fundamentals

🏫 Useful for university practicals and assignments

📝 Covers theory + practical coding exercises

💻 Prepares students for real-world applications like system programming, OS concepts, and embedded systems
